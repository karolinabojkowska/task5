## Metadata report pipeline

Bash script that makes metadata report for a given query is under the `pipelines` directory and is called `sra_metadata_report.sh`.

To use it you must first clone the current repository. You need docker daemon for the pipeline to work. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/ for downloading docker.

Usage :
```
bash sra_query_report.sh <"query string"> <output_dir_absolute_path> <metics_file_format> ( pdf or html )
```
The script takes three arguments
- query string : "a space separated list of key words"
- output_dir_absolute_path : absolute path to the working directory where the results will be output
- metrics_file_format : format of the output file - pdf or html

#### Usage example for "mouse liver Chip-seq embryo Illumina" query for an output directory /home/karo/Documents/report and format pdf
```
bash /path/to/sra_query_report.sh "mouse liver Chip-seq embryo Illumina" /home/karo/Documents/report pdf
```
## Building docker images

If you want to modify and build the images yourself, the source files for docker containers can be found in the directories :

- docker-pysradb

- docker-plotmetadata

You must clone the current repository first and navigate to the repo for which you want to build the image.

You need docker daemon to rebuild the docker image. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/.

Additional information about the docker images and their functioning are in the README.md files in the docker directories.

To build the docker image:
```
cd docker-pysradb

docker build -t docker-pysradb . # --network=host

cd docker-plotmetadata

docker build -t docker-plotmetadata . # --network=host

docker image ls
```
## Possible improvments

There are many possible changes and developments to my proposed solution. 

It would be useful to have an additional way to retrieve detailed metadata for pre-selected studies. This would also allow accessing the http paths to fastq files. One could imagine subsetting the metrics table with a user-specified `config.txt` file with the values for specific metrics in the following format: 
```
$ cat config.txt
organism_name=Mus musculus
instrument=Illumina Hiseq 2500,Illumina Novaseq 6000
library_strategy=cDNA,RT-PCR
```
We could then use the (adapted) python script `docker-pysradb/scripts/get_sra_metadata.py` to retrieve detailed metadata for specific library accession numbers and maybe plot some additional metadata to get further insight into the study metadata.

Said that, I believe that the best would be to make a web application that uses (some of) the docker containers I created. One could enter the query words and the app would retrieve the table with metadata. It could also propose (dynamic) graphs for given metrics from a drop-down menu that would facilitate library selection.
